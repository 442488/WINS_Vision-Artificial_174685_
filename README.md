This project proposes a real-time monitoring solution based on computer vision that identifies wildlife and alerts security staff to prevent incidents.

The system combines traditional image processing filters and deep learning detection (YOLOv8) to recognize multiple animal species and distinguish them from humans. WINS aims to promote safety, coexistence, and sustainability through ethical, accessible, and non-invasive AI.
